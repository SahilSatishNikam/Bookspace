                      <h5>The Emperor of All Maladies</h5>
                      The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer by
                      Siddhartha Mukherjee is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book
                      published in 2010.
                      It traces the history of cancer from its earliest
                      documented cases to modern treatments.
                      Mukherjee, an oncologist, blends medical science with
                      patient stories and personal reflections.
                      The book explores the evolution of cancer research,
                      therapies, and public perception.
                      A powerful narrative, it humanizes cancer while providing
                      deep scientific insight.<br><br>

                      <h5>Oxygen Advantages</h5>
                      The Oxygen Advantage by Patrick McKeown teaches that most
                      people over-breathe, reducing oxygen efficiency and
                      harming health.
                      It emphasizes nasal, light, and slow breathing to improve
                      oxygen delivery using the Bohr Effect.
                      Key tools like the BOLT score help track breathing
                      efficiency and progress.
                      Breath-holding and simulated altitude training improve
                      endurance, focus, and red blood cell production.
                      The book links better breathing to reduced anxiety, asthma
                      relief, improved sleep, and athletic performance.
                      Its methods are practical, science-based, and suitable for
                      both athletes and everyday people.<br><br>

                      The Science, Medicine, and Mythology of Menstruation by
                      Dr. Jen Gunter was published in January 2024.
                      It aims to debunk myths and stigma around menstruation
                      using clear, evidence-based science.
                      Dr. Gunter explains the biology of periods, hormonal
                      cycles, and common menstrual disorders.
                      She addresses topics like PMS, PCOS, endometriosis, period
                      products, and misinformation online.
                      The book challenges the cultural shame around menstruation
                      and criticizes patriarchal health narratives.
                      Written in a bold, witty style, it empowers readers to

                      When Breath Becomes Air is a memoir by Dr. Paul Kalanithi,
                      published in 2016 after his death from lung cancer.
                      The book chronicles his journey from literature student to
                      neurosurgeon to terminally ill patient.
                      It explores themes of mortality, purpose, and what makes
                      life meaningful.
                      Kalanithi reflects on the doctor-patient relationship from
                      both sides.
                      The writing is philosophical, emotional, and deeply
                      personal.

                      <h5> Breath</h5>
                      The book highlights the importance of nasal breathing,
                      slow and deep breaths for better health.
                      Nestor combines ancient breathing practices with modern
                      scientific research.
                      He shares personal experiments showing how changing
                      breathing habits improves sleep, anxiety, and athletic
                      performance.
                      The book reveals connections between breathing and
                      conditions like asthma and sleep apnea.
                      Written in an engaging style, it’s inspired a global
                      resurgence of interest in breathwork.<br><br>

                      <h5>Jaws</h5>
                      The Story of a Hidden Epidemic by Sandra Kahn and Paul R.
                      Ehrlich reveals how modern habits like soft diets and
                      mouth breathing have led to underdeveloped jaws and
                      widespread health issues. The book explains that poor jaw
                      growth contributes to crooked teeth, sleep apnea, bad
                      posture, and even impaired brain function.Instead, they
                      advocate fornatural solutions like proper chewing, nasal breathing,
                      and correct tongue posture. Blending science and clinical
                      insight, the book calls for early, preventive action to
                      combat this "hidden epidemic."<br><br>

                      <h5>Why We Sleep</h5>
                      Neuroscientist and sleep expert Matthew Walker provides a
                      revolutionary exploration of sleep, examining how it
                      affects every aspect of our physical and mental
                      well-being. Charting the most cutting-edge scientific
                      breakthroughs, and marshalling his decades of research and
                      clinical practice, Walker explains how we can harness
                      sleep to improve learning, mood and energy levels,
                      regulate hormones, prevent cancer, Alzheimer's and
                      diabetes, slow the effects of aging, and increase
                      longevity. He also provides actionable steps towards
                      getting a better night's sleep every night.<br><br>

                      <h5>Blind Spots</h5>
                      In Blind Spots, Dr. Marty Makary examines how systemic
                      issues in modern medicine—such as groupthink, bias, and
                      resistance to new evidence—have led to public health
                      missteps. He highlights examples like the opioid crisis,
                      the peanut allergy epidemic, and the overuse of
                      antibiotics to illustrate how medical dogma can hinder
                      progress. Makary advocates for a more transparent,
                      evidence-based approach to healthcare, encouraging both
                      professionals and patients to question established norms
                      and seek out the underlying science behind medical
                      recommendations.<br><br>

                      <h5> Follow the Science</h5>
                      In Follow the Science, Sharyl Attkisson delves into the
                      intricate relationships between the pharmaceutical
                      industry, government agencies, and the media. She examines
                      how these entities often prioritize profits over public
                      health, leading to misinformation and compromised medical
                      practices. Attkisson presents case studies and
                      investigative findings to highlight instances where
                      scientific data has been manipulated or suppressed, urging
                      readers to critically assess the information presented as

                <p>The Emperor of All Maladies is a magnificent, profoundly
                  humane “biography” of cancer - from its first documented
                  appearances thousands of years ago through the epic battles in
                  the twentieth century to cure, control, and conquer it to a
                  radical new understanding of its essence.

                  Physician, researcher, and award-winning science writer,
                  Siddhartha Mukherjee examines cancer with a cellular
                  biologist's precision, a historian's perspective, and a
                  biographer's passion. The result is an astonishingly lucid and
                  eloquent chronicle of a disease humans have lived with - and
                  perished from - for more than five thousand years.

                  The story of cancer is a story of human ingenuity, resilience,
                  and perseverance, but also of hubris, paternalism, and
                  misperception. Mukherjee recounts centuries of discoveries,
                  setbacks, victories, and deaths, told through the eyes of his
                  predecessors and peers, training their wits against an
                  infinitely resourceful adversary that, just three decades ago,
                  was thought to be easily vanquished in an all-out “war against
                  cancer.”

                  The book reads like a literary thriller with cancer as the
                  protagonist. From the Persian Queen Atossa, whose Greek slave
                  cut off her malignant breast, to the nineteenth-century
                  recipients of primitive radiation and chemotherapy to
                  Mukherjee's own leukemia patient, Carla, The Emperor of All
                  Maladies is about the people who have soldiered through
                  fiercely demanding regimens in order to survive—and to
                  increase our understanding of this iconic disease.

                  Riveting, urgent, and surprising, The Emperor of All Maladies
                  provides a fascinating glimpse into the future of cancer
                  treatments. It is an illuminating book that provides hope and
                  clarity to those seeking to demystify cancer.

                <p>For readers of Atul Gawande, Andrew Solomon, and Anne Lamott,
                  a profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir by a young
                  neurosurgeon faced with a terminal cancer diagnosis who
                  attempts to answer the question
                  'What makes a life worth living?'

                  At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a
                  decade's worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi
                  was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a
                  doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient
                  struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his
                  wife had imagined evaporated. When Breath Becomes Air
                  chronicles Kalanithi's transformation from a naïve medical
                  student "possessed," as he wrote,
                  "by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life"
                  into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most
                  critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient
                  and new father confronting his own mortality.

                  What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you
                  do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in
                  life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean
                  to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away?
                  These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in
                  this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.

                  Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book,
                  yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all.
                  "I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,"
                  he wrote.
                  "Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: 'I can't go on. I'll go on.'"
                  When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming
                  reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the
                  relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant
                  writer who became both.

                <p>Blood: The Science, Medicine, and Mythology of Menstruation
                  by Dr. Jen Gunter is a comprehensive, empowering, and
                  myth-busting exploration of menstruation, published in January
                  2024. Known for her no-nonsense approach to women's health,
                  Dr. Gunter combines scientific rigor with accessible language
                  and humor to dismantle centuries of misinformation, stigma,
                  and shame surrounding periods. The book covers a wide range of
                  topics including the biology of the menstrual cycle, hormonal
                  changes, common conditions like PMS, endometriosis, PCOS, and
                  fibroids, as well as the science behind period pain, menstrual
                  products, and even the social and political implications of
                  menstruation. She also critically addresses modern issues such
                  as misinformation spread by influencers, the misuse of data
                  from period-tracking apps, and the way patriarchal narratives
                  have historically silenced or distorted menstruation. Dr.
                  Gunter's goal is to provide readers—especially those who
                  menstruate—with the tools to understand their own bodies,
                  challenge harmful myths, and make informed health choices.
                  Bold, witty, and deeply informative, Blood is both a medical
                  guide and a cultural critique, filling a crucial gap in public
                  knowledge about one of the most fundamental aspects of human
                  biology.

                    <b>Author & Publication:</b>
                    Written by journalist James Nestor.
                    Published in May 2020.<br><br>
                    <b>Purpose of the Book:</b>
                    Explores how modern humans have lost the ability to breathe
                    properly.
                    Argues that many health issues are linked to dysfunctional
                    breathing habits.<br><br>
                    <b>Core Concept:</b>
                    Breathing is not just automatic—how we breathe (nose vs.
                    mouth, fast vs. slow, deep vs. shallow) significantly
                    affects physical and mental health.<br><br>
                    <b> Health Benefits Discussed:</b>
                    Improved sleep, reduced anxiety, better focus, enhanced
                    athletic performance, and even support in managing
                    conditions like asthma and sleep apnea.<br><br>
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p>No matter what you eat, how much you exercise, how skinny or
                  young or wise you are, none of it matters if you're not
                  breathing properly.

                  There is nothing more essential to our health and well-being
                  than breathing: take air in, let it out, repeat twenty-five
                  thousand times a day. Yet, as a species, humans have lost the
                  ability to breathe correctly, with grave consequences.

                  Journalist James Nestor travels the world to figure out what
                  went wrong and how to fix it. The answers aren't found in
                  pulmonology labs, as we might expect, but in the muddy digs of
                  ancient burial sites, secret Soviet facilities, New Jersey
                  choir schools, and the smoggy streets of Sao Paulo. Nestor
                  tracks down men and women exploring the hidden science behind
                  ancient breathing practices like Pranayama, Sudarshan Kriya,
                  and Tummo and teams up with pulmonary tinkerers to
                  scientifically test long-held beliefs about how we breathe.

                  Modern research is showing us that making even slight
                  adjustments to the way we inhale and exhale can jump-start
                  athletic performance; rejuvenate internal organs; halt
                  snoring, asthma, and autoimmune disease; and even straighten
                  scoliotic spines. None of this should be possible, and yet it
                  is.

                  Drawing on thousands of years of medical texts and recent
                  cutting-edge studies in pulmonology, psychology, biochemistry,
                  and human physiology, Breath turns the conventional wisdom of
                  what we thought we knew about our most basic biological
                  function on its head. You will never breathe the same again.

                  oxygen use, increasing your health, weight loss, and sports
                  performance—whether you're a recovering couch potato or an

                  bestselling author Dr. Joseph Mercola.

                  Achieve more with less The secret to weight loss, fitness, and
                  wellness lies in the most basic and most overlooked function
                  of your body—how you breathe. One of the biggest obstacles to
                  better health and fitness is a rarely identified chronic
                  over-breathing. We often take many more breaths than we
                  need—without realizing it—contributing to poor health and
                  fitness, including a host of disorders, from anxiety and
                  asthma to insomnia and heart problems.

                  In The Oxygen Advantage, the man who has trained over 5,000
                  people—including Olympic and professional athletes—in reduced
                  breathing exercises now shares his scientifically validated
                  techniques to help you breathe more efficiently. Patrick
                  McKeown teaches you the fundamental relationship between
                  oxygen and the body, then gets you started with a Body Oxygen
                  Level Test (BOLT) to determine how efficiently your body uses
                  oxygen. He then shows you how to increase your BOLT score by
                  using light breathing exercises and learning how to simulate
                  high altitude training, a technique used by Navy SEALs and
                  professional athletes to help increase endurance, weight loss,
                  and vital red blood cells to dramatically improve
                  cardio-fitness.

                    <b>Authors & Background:</b>
                    Written by Dr. Sandra Kahn, an orthodontist specializing in
                    craniofacial growth and "forwarddontics," and Paul R.
                    Ehrlich, a renowned evolutionary biologist. Their
                    collaboration brings together expertise in physical
                    anthropology, oral health, and evolutionary science.<br><br>
                    <b>Premise & Central Idea:</b>
                    The authors argue there's a modern "hidden epidemic":
                    shrinking jaws leading to dental crowding, poor facial
                    structure, mouth breathing, and health consequences like
                    obstructed airways.<br><br>
                    <b>Proposed Solutions:</b>
                    The authors suggest simple lifestyle and behavioral
                    adjustments (like encouraging proper chewing and oral
                    posture) and alternatives to traditional orthodontics—for
                    instance, palate widening—to address underlying jaw
                    development issues.<br><br>

                <p>Jaws: The Story of a Hidden Epidemic by Sandra Kahn and Paul
                  R. Ehrlich explores the growing problem of underdeveloped jaws
                  in modern humans and its serious impact on health. The authors
                  argue that changes in diet, particularly the shift from hard,
                  fibrous foods to soft, processed ones, have drastically
                  reduced the amount of chewing children do, which in turn
                  affects proper jaw development. This underdevelopment leads
                  not only to crowded, crooked teeth but also to more serious
                  issues like obstructed airways, mouth breathing, sleep apnea,
                  TMJ disorders, poor posture, and even behavioral and cognitive
                  challenges. Kahn, an orthodontist, and Ehrlich, an
                  evolutionary biologist, combine their expertise to show how
                  this epidemic stems from an evolutionary mismatch between our
                  biology and modern lifestyle. Rather than relying solely on
                  traditional orthodontic solutions like braces, which often
                  treat symptoms rather than root causes, the book advocates for
                  early intervention through natural approaches—encouraging
                  nasal breathing, correct tongue posture, and chewing harder
                  foods during childhood. With a compelling blend of science,
                  medicine, and anthropology, Jaws offers a powerful case for
                  rethinking how we approach oral and airway health from the
                  ground up.

                <p>Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker is a groundbreaking
                  exploration of the science of sleep and its vital role in our
                  health, brain function, and longevity. Drawing from decades of
                  neuroscience and clinical research, Walker explains how sleep
                  is not just a passive state but an active and essential
                  process for physical restoration, emotional balance, memory
                  consolidation, learning, creativity, and immune support. The
                  book delves into the two main types of sleep—REM and
                  Non-REM—each with distinct and critical benefits for the body
                  and brain. Walker warns that chronic sleep deprivation, which
                  is increasingly common in modern society due to work demands,
                  screen exposure, and poor sleep hygiene, is linked to a wide
                  range of health problems, including Alzheimer's disease, heart
                  attacks, obesity, depression, weakened immunity, and even
                  shortened lifespan. He critiques cultural attitudes that
                  glorify sleeplessness and highlights how institutions like
                  schools and workplaces ignore biological sleep needs,
                  especially in teenagers. The book also offers practical advice
                  to improve sleep quality—such as maintaining a consistent
                  sleep schedule, avoiding caffeine and screens before bed, and
                  creating a sleep-friendly environment. Ultimately, *Why We
                  Sleep* serves as both a wake-up call and a guide, urging
                  readers to prioritize sleep not just for better energy, but
                  for overall physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

                    <b>Overview:</b> The book presents a framework connecting metabolic
                    health to overall well-being, emphasizing the role of
                    cellular energy in preventing chronic diseases.<br><Br>

                <p>What if depression, anxiety, infertility, insomnia, heart
                  disease, erectile dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's,
                  dementia, cancer and many other health conditions that torture
                  and shorten our lives actually have the same root cause?

                  Our ability to prevent and reverse these conditions - and feel
                  incredible today - is under our control and simpler than we
                  think. The key is our metabolic function - the most important
                  and least understood factor in our overall health. As Dr.
                  Casey Means explains in this groundbreaking book, nearly every
                  health problem we face can be explained by how well the cells
                  in our body create and use energy. To live free from
                  frustrating symptoms and life-threatening disease, we need our
                  cells to be optimally powered so that they can create
                  "good energy," the essential fuel that impacts every aspect of
                  our physical and mental wellbeing.

                  If you are battling minor signals of "bad energy" inside your
                  body, it is often a warning sign that more life-threatening
                  illness may emerge later in life. But here's the good news:
                  for the first time ever, we can monitor our metabolic health
                  in great detail and learn how to improve it ourselves.

                  Weaving together cutting-edge research and personal stories,
                  as well as groundbreaking data from the health technology
                  company Dr. Means founded, Good Energy offers an essential
                  four-week plan and explains:

                  • The five biomarkers that determine your risk for a deadly
                  disease.
                  • How to use inexpensive tools and technology to
                  "see inside your body" and take action.
                  • Why dietary philosophies are designed to confuse us, and six
                  lifelong food principles you can implement whether you're
                  carnivore or vegan.
                  • The crucial links between sleep, circadian rhythm, and
                  metabolism.
                  • A new framework for exercise focused on building simple
                  movement into everyday activities.
                  • How cold and heat exposure helps build our body's
                  resilience.
                  • Steps to navigate the medical system to get what you need
                  for optimal health.

                  Good Energy offers a new, cutting-edge understanding of the
                  true cause of illness that until now has remained hidden. It
                  will help you optimize your ability to live well and stay well
                  at every age.

                <p>From Johns Hopkins medical expert Dr. Marty Makary, the New York
                Times- bestselling author of The Price We Pay —an eye-opening
                look at the medical groupthink that has led to public harm, and
                what you need to know about your health.

                More Americans have peanut allergies today than at any point in
                history. Why? In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued
                a strict recommendation that parents avoid giving their children
                peanut products until they're three years old. Getting the
                science perfectly backward, triggering intolerance with lack of
                early exposure, the US now leads the world in peanut
                allergies—and this misinformation is still rearing its head
                today.

                How could the experts have gotten it so wrong? Dr. Marty Makary
                asks, Could it be that many modern-day health crises have been
                caused by the hubris of the medical establishment? Experts said
                for decades that opioids were not addictive, igniting the opioid
                crisis. They refused menopausal women hormone replacement
                therapy, causing unnecessary suffering. They demonized natural
                fat in foods, driving Americans to processed carbohydrates as
                obesity rates soared. They told citizens that there are no
                downsides to antibiotics and prescribed them liberally, causing
                a drug-resistant bacteria crisis.

                When modern medicine issues recommendations based on good
                scientific studies, it shines. Conversely, when modern medicine
                is interpreted through the harsh lens of opinion and edict, it
                can mold beliefs that harm patients and stunt research for
                decades. In Blind Spots, Dr. Makary explores the latest research
                on critical topics ranging from the microbiome to childbirth to
                nutrition and longevity and more, revealing the biggest blind
                spots of modern medicine and tackling the most urgent yet unsung
                issues in our $4.5 trillion health care ecosystem. The path to
                medical mishaps can be absurd, entertaining, and
                jaw-dropping—but the truth is essential to our health.</p>

                <p>Respected Emmy Award-winning investigative journalist and New
                  York Times bestselling author of Stonewalled, The Smear, and
                  Slanted exposes the corruption that has ruled the
                  pharmaceutical industry and news media for decades. Through
                  blatant lies, deep cover-ups, and high-level collusion with
                  government and media, Big Pharma has continuously put profits
                  over people with dangerous results. Now, with her signature
                  investigative rigor and uncompromising commitment to the
                  facts, Sharyl Attkisson takes readers on an eye-opening
                  journey through the dark underbelly of the pharmaceutical
                  industry. Follow the Science recounts, in exacting detail, how
                  far the pharmaceutical industry and its supporters in
                  medicine, media, and government will go to protect their
                  profits. Attkisson provides shocking examples that reveal the
                  disturbing callousness our government, public health
                  officials, and top researchers are capable of when it comes to
                  the most vulnerable among us. And she explains, in a graphic
                  sense, how some of the most trusted within our society are
                  willing to commit life-threatening ethics violations. When
                  caught, they circle the wagons and marshal forces to defend
                  their bad acts, and take steps to cruelly silence the injured
                  and smear those who would expose them. Big Pharma's critics
                  are often silenced or labeled “science deniers.” Even major
                  media stories have been suppressed to placate pharmaceutical
                  advertisers. The rift has only grown since the major
                  pharmaceutical companies and their allies attacked anyone who
                  dared to question the Covid-19 vaccines, and new treatments
                  that provided disappointing despite skyrocketing costs. Follow
                  the Science will challenge your assumptions, open your eyes,
                  and inspire you to take action. With its powerful message of
                  truth and justice, this book is a must-read for anyone who
                  cares about the future of our healthcare system and their own
