                  At age 12, children in Jonas's community are assigned lifelong
                  roles. Jonas is given the rare and honored position of
                  Receiver of Memory, apprenticed to The Giver, who transmits to
                  him memories of a time before the society's rules—memories of
                  joy, pain, color, music, and love, but also war, hunger, and
                  death. As Jonas experiences these intense emotions and truths,
                  he begins to question the morality of his community's way of
                  life. When he discovers a shocking secret about how the
                  community handles unwanted individuals—including infants—Jonas
                  makes a brave choice to escape and bring change.

                <h4>Brave New World</h4>
                <h6>Author:</h6> Aldous Huxley.
                <h6>Published:</h6> 1932.
                <h6>Genre:</h4> Dystopian, science fiction, social commentary.
                <h6>Setting:</h6> London and a "Savage Reservation," in the
                World State,
                circa the year 2540 AD (or AF 632, "After Ford").

            </div>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Set in a futuristic world ruled by a powerful global government
              called the World State, society is built on the principles of
              stability, uniformity, and pleasure. Natural birth, families, and
              individuality have been eliminated. Instead, humans are
              genetically engineered and conditioned from birth into strict
              social castes (Alpha to Epsilon) designed for specific roles.

              People live lives filled with instant gratification, encouraged to
              consume endlessly and avoid discomfort. To suppress negative
              emotions, they use a drug called soma, which ensures people remain
              content and unquestioning.

              The story follows Bernard Marx, an Alpha who feels alienated and
              dissatisfied with the shallow pleasures of society. He travels to
              a Savage Reservation with Lenina Crowne, a conformist Beta. There,
              they meet John, a man born naturally and raised outside the World
              State, with traditional human values and knowledge of Shakespeare.

              When Bernard brings John back to the World State, he becomes a
              sensation — the “Savage” everyone wants to see. But John is
              horrified by the lack of meaning, love, and individuality in this
              seemingly perfect society. He struggles to find a place in this
              world, ultimately leading to a tragic end.

            Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a dystopian novel set in a
            future society where books are banned and "firemen" burn any that
            are found. The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman who begins to
            question the purpose of his job and the oppressive, shallow society
            he lives in. Sparked by encounters with his curious young neighbor
            Clarisse and the traumatic suicide of a woman who chooses to die
            with her books, Montag starts secretly reading, seeking meaning and
            truth. As he grows more rebellious, he turns to a former English
            professor, Faber, for guidance. Montag eventually escapes the city
            and joins a group of intellectual drifters who have memorized entire
            books to preserve knowledge for a future society. The novel explores
            themes of censorship, conformity, the dehumanizing effects of
            technology, and the transformative power of literature and free
            thought. Bradbury’s powerful critique of a passive, media-obsessed
            world remains chillingly relevant today.

            The Giver by Lois Lowry is a dystopian novel set in a
            seemingly perfect society that has eliminated pain, conflict,
            and emotion by enforcing strict rules, sameness, and the
            erasure of personal memories. The story follows Jonas, a
            12-year-old boy selected to become the Receiver of Memory, the
            only person who holds the truth about the world's
            past—memories of love, war, color, and suffering. As Jonas
            receives these memories from his mentor, The Giver, he begins
            to see the dark reality behind his community's controlled
            peace and lack of true freedom. Disturbed by what he
            learns—especially the community's practice of euthanasia—Jonas
            ultimately decides to risk everything to escape and bring
            change. The novel explores themes of individuality, memory,
            freedom, and the importance of emotional depth, making it a
            powerful and thought-provoking story that remains a staple in
            young adult literature.

            The Hunger Games is a dystopian novel by Suzanne Collins, published
            in 2008,
            and the first book in the bestselling trilogy (Catching Fire and
            Mockingjay
            follow). Set in the totalitarian nation of Panem, a future version
            of North
            America, the story follows Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old girl from
            the
            impoverished District 12. Each year, the Capitol forces one boy and
            one girl
            from each of the 12 districts to participate in the Hunger Games—a
            televised
            death match meant to both entertain and remind the districts of
            their
            subjugation after a failed rebellion. When Katniss volunteers to
            take her
            younger sister's place, she is thrown into a brutal fight for
            survival
            against 23 other tributes, including Peeta Mellark, a boy from her
            district
            who may or may not be her ally. As the Games unfold, Katniss must
            navigate
            deadly threats, manipulate public perception, and challenge the
            cruelty of
            the Capitol. The novel explores themes of oppression, survival,
            media
            manipulation, inequality, rebellion, and sacrifice, with a strong,
            morally
            complex heroine at its center. It has received widespread acclaim
            for its
            intense plot, sharp social commentary, and emotional depth, and was
            adapted
            into a successful film series starring Jennifer Lawrence.

            The Maze Runner by James Dashner is a thrilling young adult
            dystopian novel centered on Thomas,a teenage boy who suddenly
            finds himself trapped in the Glade—a large, enclosed area surrounded
            by towerin stone walls that open to a massive and ever-shifting
            Maze.
            Thomas arrives with no memory of who he is or how he got there, just
            like the other boys living in the Glade,
            who have established their own society governed by rules and
            assigned roles to survive. The Maze itself is a
            deadly puzzle filled with lethal creatures called Grievers, and for
            years the boys, known as Gladers, have
            tried unsuccessfully to solve it and find an escape. Thomas's
            arrival triggers a series of events, including
            the appearance of the first girl, Teresa, who shares a mysterious
            telepathic connection with him. As Thomas
            learns more about the Maze, his unique instincts and bravery push
            him to challenge the established order,
            inspiring the Gladers to band together to unravel the secrets of
            their captivity. The novel explores deep themes
            such as the importance of teamwork and leadership, the search for
            identity amidst lost memories, and the consequences
            of manipulation and control by unseen forces. Full of suspense,
            action, and mystery, The Maze Runner is the start of
            a larger story about survival and rebellion against a dystopian
            experiment that tests human endurance and spirit.

            Mind Games by Kiersten White is a gripping young adult paranormal
            thriller centered on Ruby “Riv” Kennedy,
            a strong and determined teenage girl born with extraordinary psychic
            abilities, including telekinesis and mind-reading.
            Raised and trained by her father to combat a secret and sinister
            organization called the Agents—who exploit people with
            similar powers for their own dark purposes—Riv's life is thrown into
            chaos when her father is captured by the very enemies
            they've been fighting against. Forced to infiltrate the Agents
            undercover, Riv navigates a dangerous world of deception,
            shifting alliances, and hidden agendas, all while grappling with her
            own sense of identity and morality. As she uncovers
            the deeper truths behind the ongoing conflict, Riv must decide whom
            to trust and how far she's willing to go to save her
            family and protect others like her. With a fast-paced narrative full
            of supernatural action, psychological intrigue,
            and emotional depth, Mind Games explores complex themes of power,
            control, loyalty, and the often-blurred line between
            good and evil, making it a compelling read for fans of paranormal
            suspense and YA mysteries.

                <h6>Author:</h6> William Golding.

            Lord of the Flies by William Golding is a powerful allegorical novel
            about a group of British boys stranded on a deserted island without
            adult supervision. As they try to govern themselves and await
            rescue, the boys fragile sense of civilization quickly breaks down,
            leading to chaos, violence, and savagery. Through characters like
            Ralph, who represents order, and Jack, who embodies primal instincts
            and the lust for power, the story explores deep themes such as the
            conflict between civilization and barbarism, the loss of innocence,
            and the inherent darkness within human nature. Symbolism plays a key
            role, with objects like the conch shell symbolizing authority and
            the "Lord of the Flies" (a pig's head on a stick) representing the
            evil lurking inside everyone. Golding's novel serves as a haunting
            commentary on society, human behavior, and the thin line separating
            order from chaos.
